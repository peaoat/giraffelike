# Giraffelike

> It's your first day on the job at the giraffactory. You don't really know your way around, but you were told to report
to your desk on floor... what floor was it? Have a look around until something rings a bell.<br/><br/>
There's been a bit of a problem with some vermin lurking about, so watch out for critters! <br/><br/>

## Requires Python 3.6!

### Please use `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install tdl and its requirements

_I recommend using a virtualenv :)_

#### Controls:
- Arrow keys = Move
- spacebar = Twiddle your thumbs
- shift = pick up an item
- i = open your inventory
- d = drop an item from inventory
- s = cast spell
- \ = walk down stairs ("\\")

##### Tips:
- If you move into an enemy, you will attack that enemy
- Enemies can move and attack diagonally, while you cannot. Plan accordingly!
- REG increases the amount of healing you receive from resting and drinking potions
