# Giraffelike

> It's your first day on the job at the giraffactory. You don't really know your way around, but you were told to report
to your desk on floor... what floor was it? Have a look around until something rings a bell.<br/><br/>
There's been a bit of a problem with some vermin lurking about, so watch out for critters! <br/><br/>

## Requirements

Python >= 3.6  
tdl

I recommend using a virtualenv!  
https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
>`pip install tdl` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` with the included requirements file

#### Controls:
- `Arrow keys` = Move
- `spacebar` = Twiddle your thumbs
- `shift` = pick up an item
- `i` = open your item inventory
- `o` = drop an item from inventory
- `e` = open your equipment inventory
- `r` = drop an item from equipment
- `s` = cast spell
- `.` (period) = walk down stairs "`>`"

##### Tips:
- If you move into an enemy, you will attack that enemy
- Enemies can move and attack diagonally, while you cannot. Plan accordingly!
- REG increases the amount of healing you receive from resting and drinking potions
- Allies are pretty OP, but only last one floor!
